# What is a Package Manager
Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications – Helm charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.
Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish – so start using Helm and stop the copy-and-paste.

As summarized by Matt Farina, a package manager is tooling that enables someone who has knowledge of an application and a platform to package up an application so that someone else who has neither extensive knowledge of the application or the way it needs to be run on the platform can use it.
