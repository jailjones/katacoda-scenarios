# Create your own chart

Now that you have explored some basic commands and learned how to manage Helm charts, we will explore creating a Helm chart from scratch

In this lab, we will create a Helm chart for a Java-Spring application from scratch

First we will create just a chart that only has a **Deployment**. Then we will add a **Service** to the chart. And lastly we will improve our **Deployment** by adding some **resource usage limitations** and **readiness/liveness probes**.
