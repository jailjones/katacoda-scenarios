# Liveness and Readiness Probes

Many applications running for long periods of time eventually transition to broken states, and cannot recover except by being restarted. Kubernetes provides liveness probes to detect and remedy such situations.
In this exercise, you create a Pod that runs a container based on the k8s.gcr.io/busybox image. Here is the configuration file for the Pod:

1. Review the following yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    test: liveness
  name: liveness-exec
spec:
  containers:
  - name: liveness
    image: k8s.gcr.io/busybox
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30; rm -rf /tmp/healthy; sleep 600
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - cat
        - /tmp/healthy
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```

2. Create the file `exec-liveness.yaml` and copy the contents from above

    `vim exec-liveness.yaml`{{execute}}

In the configuration file, you can see that the Pod has a single Container. The `periodSeconds` field specifies that the kubelet should perform a liveness probe every 5 seconds. 

The `initialDelaySeconds` field tells the kubelet that it should wait 5 seconds before performing the first probe. To perform a probe, the kubelet executes the command cat /tmp/healthy in the target container. If the command succeeds, it returns 0, and the kubelet considers the container to be alive and healthy. 

If the command returns a non-zero value, the kubelet kills the container and restarts it.
When the container starts, it executes this command:

```bash
/bin/sh -c "touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30; rm -rf /tmp/healthy; sleep 600"
```

For the first 30 seconds of the containerâ€™s life, there is a /tmp/healthy file. So during the first 30 seconds, the command cat /tmp/healthy returns a success code. After 30 seconds, cat /tmp/healthy returns a failure code.

3. Now create the pod

    `kubectl create -f ./exec-liveness.yaml`{{execute}}

    Within 30 seconds, view the Pod events:

    `kubectl describe pod liveness-exec`{{execute}}

    The output indicates that no liveness probes have failed yet:

```bash
#Example Output

FirstSeen    LastSeen    Count   From            SubobjectPath           Type        Reason      Message

```

4. After 35 seconds, view the Pod events again:

    `kubectl describe pod liveness-exec`{{execute}}

    At the bottom of the output, there are messages indicating that the liveness probes have failed, and the containers have been killed and recreated

```bash
FirstSeen LastSeen    Count   From            SubobjectPath           Type        Reason      Message
--------- --------    -----   ----            -------------           --------    ------      -------
37s       37s     1   {default-scheduler }                    Normal      Scheduled   Successfully assigned liveness-exec to worker0
36s       36s     1   {kubelet worker0}   spec.containers{liveness}   Normal      Pulling     pulling image "k8s.gcr.io/busybox"
36s       36s     1   {kubelet worker0}   spec.containers{liveness}   Normal      Pulled      Successfully pulled image "k8s.gcr.io/busybox"
36s       36s     1   {kubelet worker0}   spec.containers{liveness}   Normal      Created     Created container with docker id 86849c15382e; Security:[seccomp=unconfined]
36s       36s     1   {kubelet worker0}   spec.containers{liveness}   Normal      Started     Started container with docker id 86849c15382e
2s        2s      1   {kubelet worker0}   spec.containers{liveness}   Warning     Unhealthy   Liveness probe failed: cat: cant open '/tmp/healthy': No such file or directory
```

5. Wait another 30 seconds, and verify that the container has been restarted:

    `kubectl get pod liveness-exec`{{execute}}

The output shows that RESTARTS has been incremented:

```bash
#example output

NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
liveness-exec   1/1       Running   1          1m
```

6. Done
